This project is a Traffic-Simulator developped in case of studies project.

We developed it with *Unity3D*  in *C#*.

This simulator is based on New York City traffic, in fact there are pedestrian, differents kind of cars like truck or city-dweller car. **There is not roundabout**, cars can not cross each other and pedestrian can not cross the street.

Once you have started the program, you will be in front of the main menu where you will have several choices:
- Start a local traffic simulator

A traffic simulator will be randomly selected from a local database of document. In fact, you have a dozen of maps which are provided with the project.

- Upload your own city

Actually, maps are generated from a JSON file. We made this simulator in order to upload your own map. Everything is explained in the project or in the specification.
